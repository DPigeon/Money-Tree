We will be using maven as our dependency manager.

Test can be written in both GROOVY and JAVA (GROOVY is a superset of java, much easier to write and you can write java inside groovy files).
Testing framework is SPOCK. (https://www.baeldung.com/groovy-spock for spock with springboot examples) 
(http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3/all_in_one.html actual documentation of spock in a single page)


For intellij, please download the gmaven plus plugin to be able to run the tests from intellij IDEA.
